					        Aaron Mickelson's Proposals for Disappearing Packaging:
					        	<br><br><br><span>For his Masters Thesis in Packaging Design at Pratt Institute, Aaron Mickelson created a series of eco-friendly packages that are designed to be consumed with the products they hold such that no waste remains. Per his description of the Disappearing Package:<br><br><br>

Every year, we throw away a ton of packaging waste (actually, over 70 million tons). It makes up the single largest percentage of trash in our landfills (beating out industrial waste, electronics, food... everything). Figures released by the EPA indicate this problem is getting worse every year.<br><br>
As a package designer (and grad student—meaning I know everything and can solve every problem, naturally), I was concerned about where this trend is going. Of course, many talented designers working in the field have made great efforts over the past few years to reduce the amount of packaging that goes onto a product. However, for my Masters Thesis, I asked the question: Can we eliminate that waste entirely?

					        Symmetry is Overrated: Paolo de Giusti's XXXVI DG Bicycle Concept:
						    <br><br><br><span>
						    Based on the description of his latest project, it's safe to assume that Paolo de Giusti is sick of all of the newfangled concept bikes that seem to be all the rage these days. Whether they're design competition entries or simply eye-catching renderings, the Italian art director simply isn't impressed. But beyond hoarding vintage Campy components like your average retrogrouch (not that there's anything wrong with that), he proposes yet another variation of the concept bike:<br><br>

It is not a folding bike, nor is it an electric- or battery-powered bike. It is not iOS-ready. You can't plug your music/phone/camera into it. This is the XXXVI DG—quite simply, this is a bicycle. Two wheels. Two pedals. One Seat. Inspired by bicycles for bicycle lovers, combining traditional elements and components in an unconventional yet innovative way. The frame takes its shape from a simple desire for asymmetric aesthetics, while at the same time providing a stable cave-like covering for the wheels and preserving the bicycle's ergonomic features.

						        Designing Things to Hold Other Things: the Staybowlizer for Commercial Kitchens:
						        <br><br><br><span>
						        Smartphones need cases, coffee mugs need coasters, hunting knives need sheathes. It's weird to think about how many products are not designed with their own base or carrying case, and as it turns out, that's an opportunity for sharp-eyed product designers. Designing an object whose sole purpose is to protect or augment another object is something we never covered in design school, but apparently it's lucrative.<br><br>

The latest case in point: The Staybowlizer silicone thingamajig you see above. Your standard mixing bowl is made out of stainless steel or glass, which has a tendency to slide on your standard commercial kitchen prep surface of stainless steel or wood.</span>

					        Team 7's Elegant Flaye Extendable Table:
						     <br><br><br><span>  
						     Team 7 is an Austrian outfit that manufacturers furniture out of (gasp!) natural wood, using walnut combined into three plies. Led by experienced wood designer Jacob Strobel, they've created a byoootiful extending table with well-concealed extra panels. I've seen similar mechanisms before, but the easy, elegant precision of this one, coupled with the gorgeous walnut finish, has me drooling.
						     <br><br>
						     It's called the Flaye, and unsurprisingly there's no video of what we designers all want to see—what's going on below the table during the action. All they'll say is that it works via "revolutionary non-stop synchronised pull-out technology."
